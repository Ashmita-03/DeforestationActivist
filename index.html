  <p class="block">Fun Fact:</p>
    <p class="block"> Forests and climate
      <ul>Forests cover about 31% of Earth’s land area, but we lose around 10 million hectares every year due to deforestation.</ul>

    <ul>Trees absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen — one mature tree can provide oxygen for up to 4 people daily.</ul>

    <ul>Deforestation contributes about 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions.</ul></p>

    <p class="block"> Wildlife
      <ul>Nearly 80% of Earth’s land animals and plants live in forests, and deforestation threatens their survival.</ul>

    <ul>The Amazon rainforest alone is home to about 10% of known species on Earth.</ul>

    <ul>Habitat destruction is one of the main causes of species extinction worldwide.</ul></p>

    <p class="block"> People
      <ul>Over 1.6 billion people depend directly on forests for their food, shelter, and income.</ul>

    <ul>Forests provide medicines, fruits, nuts, and clean water for millions of communities.</ul>

    <ul>Protecting forests helps indigenous cultures preserve their traditions and way of life.</ul></p>
