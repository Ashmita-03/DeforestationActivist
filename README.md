# Deforestation Awareness website

### Overview
This project is built as a project in girls who code summercamp for raising awareness about deforestation, and as intial effort to stop deforestation and climate change. This website has informative facts and quotes to educate the audience who uses this website. Additionally the pictures , layout and the color scheme keep the audience engaing and involved in the topic. I made this project to address the problems that deforestation can lead to, and to stop the root cause of all the problems, which is DEFORESTATION.
